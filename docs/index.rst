===========

GUI to facilitate conducting experiments with multi-probe e-phys (Neuropixels),
multi-channel audio (Avisoft) and multi-camera video (Loopbio) acquisition.
Developed for behavioral recording purposes at the
[Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/)
2021-25 (Falkner/Murthy labs). Due to proprietary software design and limitations,
recordings can only be performed on OS Windows. The data processing, analysis
and visualization branches of the GUI are platform-independent.
