usv-playpen
===========

Welcome!  *usv-playpen* is a graphical user interface (henceforth, GUI) which facilitates conducting
experiments with multi-probe e-phys (Neuropixels), multi-channel audio (Avisoft) and multi-camera
video (Loopbio) acquisition. Developed for behavioral recording purposes at the
`Princeton Neuroscience Institute <https://pni.princeton.edu/>`_
2021-25 (`Falkner <https://www.falknerlab.com/>`_/`Murthy <https://murthylab.princeton.edu/>`_ labs).
Due to proprietary software design and limitations, recordings can only be performed on OS Windows.
The data processing, analysis and visualization branches of the GUI are platform-independent.

This manual is divided in fice sections: *Prerequisites*, *Record*, *Process*, *Analyze*, and *Visualize*. Each section is a
step-by-step guide to the respective functionalities of the GUI. As the GUI is developing gradually over
time, the manual is also a work in progress. We have tried to design the GUI with the experimenter in
mind, whether it is a technician, graduate student or postdoc, with little or no background experience
in engineering or programming. We have also tried to condense and simplify the manual as much as possible,
This instruction set was made by users for users, with the ultimate aim of helping you collect your data and
analyze it painlessly. Despite its highly automated nature, where complex functions are several button
clicks away, the GUI is not dummy-proof. It is important to understand the system and the checks you need
to put in place to make sure you are using the tool correctly. Should you have any questions, please
do not hesitate to contact us, thorough Github or email.
